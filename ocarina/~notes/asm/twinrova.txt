Phantom Twinrova (T:1F7EE0) instance (load directly into Twinrova's room)

Type 2 Twinrova is the boss instance

At instance + 0x14A stores Twinrova's Invunerability count down timer. 0x14 on hits, but is set to 0x2710 on final blow
When it reaches 0, nothing happens if the glitch wasn't set up correctly

instance + 0x4E4 is a byte value storing whether Twinrova has been hit by a charged Mirror Shield attack. If this is 1 when the timer above is 0, twinrova will come back from the dead
