func_8005C364 (initializes hitbox structure, always used before func_8005C4AC)

a0 - global context
a1 - actor instance + 0x014C (offset of hitbox struct in the instance)

func_8005C4AC (loads hitbox variable array to hitbox structure)

a0 - global context
a1 - actor instance + 0x014C (offset of hitbox struct in the instance)
a2 - actor instance
a3 - hitbox variable array

func_8005C3AC (unloads hitbox structure, use in destructor)

a0 - global context
a1 - actor instance + 0x014C (offset where you stored the hitbox struct)

func_800626DC (enables hitbox?)

a0 - actor instance
a1 - actor instance + 0x014C (offset of hitbox struct in the instance)

func_80077A00 (float aproximator (not sure how to call this))

a0 - actor instance + 0x0198 (offset of stored float)
a1 - float value (target float)
a2 - float value (increments or decrements result by this until it reaches the target float)
v0 - returns 0 if it hasn't reached it, 1 if it does


8005BBF8    Initializes hitbox structure (different purpose than 8005C364?)
a0 - global context
a1 - actor instance + 0x0150 (offset of hitbox struct in the instance) 

8005C050    Loads hitbox variable array to hitbox structure  (different purpose than 8005C4AC?)
a0 - global context
a1 - actor instance + 0x0150 (offset of hitbox struct in the instance)
a2 - actor instance
a3 - hitbox variable array 

8005BCC8    Unloads hitbox structure  (different purpose than 8005C3AC?)
a0 - global context
a1 - actor instance + 0x0150 (offset where you stored the hitbox struct)

8007841C    smoothly aproximates a0 to a1, commonly used for smooth movement
a0 - actor instance + xxxx (offset of the float that will change)
a1 - float where you want a0 to be aproximated to
a2 - float (amount?)
a3 - float (smaller than a2)

8002B1E0    Draws circular shadow until instance is destroyed (use in constructor)
a0 - actor instance + 0xB4
a1 - float unknown (will be stored at a0 + 0x08)
a2 - 8002B5EC (draw function of shadow, will be stored at a0 + 0x0C)
a3 - float unknown (will be stored at a0 + 0x10)

8006BAD8    plays sound at position
a0 - global context
a1 - actor instance + 0x24 (position array of the sound)
a2 - 0x3C (radius?)
a3 - sound ID

8005B200    retrieves damage chart table pointer, called by all actors that doesn't have their damage chart inside overlay
a0 - entry ID of some table? varies between actors
v0 - returns pointer that's used in a1 of damage chart initializer (80061EFC)
