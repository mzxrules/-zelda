80886284 - Assigns a random edging color to generic fairies
//A0 = Randomization type for color channel, 0-2. Data within byte array located at off 0x43D4?
//F0 = Returns color channel intensity
//
//Starts with jump table to set what randomization to use
//
62A0 // Type 0. Simply returns 0 as current color channel
//
62AC // Type 1.
//Randomly generates number between 0 and 55 exclusive, adds 200, returns as color channel
//
62D0 // Type 2. 
//Randomly generates number between 0 and 255 exclusive, returns as color channel

== Data ==
global off 0x4494 float = number of randomized "Kokiri" style fairy color types. Value = 11.99f. Used to generate a random number between 0-11.99f, then result is incremented by 1, cast to int, and used to index the edge color table.
global off 0x43D4 = Randomized "Kokiri" style fairy edge "colors".
13 records (index 0 unused), 3 bytes per record. Each
byte sets how the color channels will be randomized:
* 0 = color channel is 0
* 1 = color channel is randomized to 200-255
* 2 = color channel is randomized to 0-255
