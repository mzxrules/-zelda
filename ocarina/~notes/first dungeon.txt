Project First Level

A mini oot troll hack of Dodongo's Cavern

Dungeon progression should follow the core vanilla route
Savewarping should put you back to void coordinates
Passing through a black void should set a void checkpoint



Entrance, bombable wall
Ideas:
    blowing up the wall deletes the floor, blue fire melts the wall safely
    
    Check scene, room number, 
    Check number of explosive actors spawned
    make below polys non-collideable by link

Actor 0058 //moving platforms in dc
//have one crush the player
//have one move to the next destination in a weird fashion
//have one rise up into the air into nowhere


Instant Flame Wall:
//reprogram vertical flame walls to rise up instantly, just use the same animation as before

put flame wall on east path middle to both stop players from shortcutting west f1 and getting back to f1 center?


East Path
    vanilla notes:
        dodongo jr. with ledge normally unreachable by child
        door to small square room (bombable wall)
    troll ideas:
        when armos is pushed onto blue switch, make it an activated enemy
        
Hallway to lizalfos fight:
    put small flame wall in center of hallway
    when backtracking, put two flame walls opposing 
    troll ideas:
        make doors locked on switch instead of lizalfos clear,
        open by jumping into the lavafall
        add pots to point to jump into the lavafall
        
Three Torches and some DigDongos
    vanilla notes:
        door to small square room (bombable wall)
        leads to button/completion of f1 east section
    troll ideas:
        make it impossible to light the three torches (stick burns out too fast)
