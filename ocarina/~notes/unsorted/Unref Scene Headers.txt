Hyrule Castle Unused Setup differences - 3D80

1 - Link when caught by the guards will not be "thrown out" but warped out without the "hurt" animation.

2 - Link when caught by the guards in Zelda's Courtyard will not be "thrown out" but walk nonchalantly out of the door that's not a door next to the castle.

3 - The Fairy Fountain takes you to the Great Fairy of Magic who gives you magic, instead of the Din's Fire fairy.



Death Mountain Unused Setup differences - 78F8

1 - Rolling Goron goes carousing to his death as he does not turn to go down the mountain.

2 - The Beta Bomb Flower Goron is present and upon speaking to him he will continue to shuffle until he hits a wall, then continues to shuffle. Well at least he has collision and doesn't go through the wall.

3 - The Great Fairy Entrance has a warp transition that Link will walk into forever, without the map ever transitioning.
