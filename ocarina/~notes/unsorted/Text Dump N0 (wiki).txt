|-
|0143||The girl from the ranch asked us<br>to find her father...I wonder where<br>he is?
|-
|0144||I wonder where we'll find the <br>princess in this big old castle?
|-
|0145||What would Saria say if we told<br>her we're going to save Hyrule?
|-
|0146||Impa said that the Spiritual Stone<br>of Fire is somewhere on Death<br>Mountain.

|-
|0155||That monster! It came out of the <br>well in the village! Let's go <br>check out the well!

|0157||Have you ever played the <br>Nocturne of Shadow that Sheik<br>taught you?
|-
|0158||The desert...that is where<br>Ganondorf the Evil King was born.<br>If we go there, we might find<br>something...

|-
|0169||Did you find all the temples yet?
|-

|-
|1002||Wow! A fairy!!<br><br>Finally, a fairy came to you,<br>[Link]![goto 100F]
|-
|1003||I'll wait for you here.<br>Get going! Go see the Great <br>Deku Tree!
|-
|1004||[A] by the stone, pick it up!<br>[A] by the stone, pick it up!<br><br>Mean old Mido...he made me pick <br>up the rocks in front of his house.
|-
|1005||Oh, you have a fairy now?!<br>That's great, [Link]!<br><br>What?<br><br>You've been called by the<br>Great Deku Tree? What an honor!<br><br>He may give you a special gift!<br>Tee hee!<br><br>That's because the Great Deku <br>Tree is our father, the forest<br>guardian, and he gave life to all <br>of us Kokiri!
|-
|1006||I wonder if the Great Deku Tree <br>gave life to everything in the<br>forest, I mean in addition to us <br>Kokiri?
|-
|1007||Hey, let's work on some moves!<br><br>To jump sideways while [Z] <br>Targeting, press [A] as you move<br>right or left.<br><br>To do a backflip while [Z] <br>Targeting, press [A] as you move<br>backwards.<br><br>To do a roll attack while [Z] <br>Targeting, press [A] as you move<br>forward. While you roll, you can<br>avoid damage.<br><br>If you have your sword ready while<br>[Z] Targeting, you can do a jump <br>attack by pressing [A]! A jump <br>attack does double damage!<br><br>You can use [Z] Targeting on the<br>stone next to me, so let's <br>practice!
|-
|1008||You're not allowed to leave the <br>forest![goto 1009]
|-
|1009||The Great Deku Tree said that if<br>a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or <br>she will die!
|-
|100A||That meanie, Mido, made me cut <br>the grass at Saria's house.<br><br>Mido told Saria he would do it so<br>she would like him, but I'm the one<br>doing all the work![goto 100B]
|-
|100B||You and Saria are close friends,<br>so will you help me cut the <br>grass?<br><br>I'll let you keep anything that <br>you find while cutting it.
|-
|100C||Yes, yes! That's how you use a<br>fairy!<br><br>It's so great that you finally have<br>a fairy partner!<br><br>I'll teach you how to talk to <br>people using your fairy![goto 100D]
|-
|100D||When a fairy flies near a person <br>or thing, press [Z] to look in that<br>direction.<br><br>If you use [Z] Targeting, you can <br>talk to people from a distance, <br>like we're doing now.<br><br>When you have nothing that you<br>can target, you can press [Z] just<br>to look forward.<br>Try it!

|100E||Oh, a fairy finally came to you!<br><br>Now you have a lot to learn![goto 1019]

|-
|1011||Oh, you're leaving...
|-
|1012||But that's OK, because we'll be<br>friends forever...<br>won't we?
|-
|1013||I want you to have this Ocarina...<br>Please take good care of it.
|-
|1014||When you play my Ocarina, I hope<br>you will think of me and come<br>back to the forest to visit.
|-
|1015||Oh... Navi...<br>Thou hast returned...<br><br>[Link]...<br>Welcome...<br><br>Listen carefully to what I, the<br>Deku Tree, am about to tell thee...<br><br>Thy slumber these past moons <br>must have been restless, and<br>full of nightmares...<br><br>As the servants of evil gain<br>strength, a vile climate pervades<br>the land and causes nightmares<br>to those sensitive to it...<br><br>Verily, thou hast felt it...<br><br>[Link]... <br>The time has come to test thy<br>courage...[goto 1016]
|-
|1016||I have been cursed...<br>I need you to break the curse<br>with your wisdom and courage.<br><br>Dost thou have courage enough<br>to undertake this task?<br>Yes<br>No
|-
|1017||Then enter, brave <br>[Link], and thou too, <br>Navi...<br><br>Navi the fairy...  <br>Thou must aid [Link]...<br><br>And [Link]...When Navi <br>speaks, use [C-Up] to listen well <br>to her words of wisdom...
|-
|1018||Perhaps you do not yet have <br>confidence in your abilities...<br>Return to the Kokiri Forest to<br>learn the skills of combat...<br><br>When thou art ready, return here <br>and speak with me by using [Z]...
|-
|1019||The best place to go to learn<br>some new skills is in the Forest <br>Training Center. It's on the hill<br>just above here.

Forgive me, master!<br>If I give you a clue, will you let <br>me go?<br><br>[sound 3880]When you jump off a high cliff,<br>if you hold [Control Stick] forward, you will<br>roll on the ground when you land <br>and won't get hurt from the fall.<br><br>[sound 3880]I can't guarantee it will<br>work, though, if the cliff is really,<br>really high, heh heh!<br><br>[sound 3880]Well, try it if you are feeling<br>bold!<br>Wah ha hah!

|101B||Hee hee!<br>Under that mask...aren't you that<br>Kokiri kid?
|-
|101C||Quite an unusual mask you have<br>there. Hee hee! I like it! It may<br>make me look a little bit tougher.<br><br>Hey, why don't you give it to me?<br><br>OK<br>No way
|-
|101D||Doh! That's too bad for me...
|-
|101E||Yowza! I'm gonna wear this <br>all the time!
|-
|101F||[sound 4807]He just gave you 10 Rupees for <br>this 20-Rupee mask! You lost <br>money on that deal!<br><br>Go back to the Mask Shop <br>and pay 20 Rupees for the <br>mask. The difference will have to <br>come out of your own pocket.
|-
|1020||My buddies really want this mask!<br>Hee hee hee!
|-
|1021||Oh, you're OK? You didn't leave <br>the forest after all, did you?
|-
|1022||Did you know that if you hold [Triangle]<br>forward when you jump off a cliff,<br>you'll roll when you land. This will<br>absorb the shock of your landing.<br><br>If you fall too far, though, you'll<br>still get hurt...
|-
|1023||Saria said she's waiting at the<br>usual spot.
|-
|1024||Well done, [Link]...
|-
|1025||You have a cool Slingshot, huh?<br><br>You know what's cool about it?<br>You can aim while holding down<br>[C] and shoot by releasing the<br>button! How cool!<br><br>If you have the Slingshot ready,<br>you can use [Z] Targeting to <br>shoot while moving.... Did you <br>know that?
|-
|1026||No, [Link]...<br>Thou must know my time is short...
|-
|1027||Now...listen carefully...<br>A wicked man of the desert <br>cast this dreadful curse upon me...
|-
|1028||If you're looking for Saria, she's<br>in the Lost Woods, as usual.<br><br>Don't tell me you don't know <br>where that is! The entrance is up<br>on the cliff overlooking the <br>village!<br><br>I know you'll get lost! Don't <br>worry, you'll just end up back at<br>the entrance!<br><br>Harumph!
|-
|1029||Thou must never allow the desert <br>man in black armor to lay his <br>hands on the sacred Triforce...<br><br>Thou must never suffer that man,<br>with his evil heart, to enter the <br>Sacred Realm of legend...<br><br>That evil man who cast the death <br>curse upon me and sapped my <br>power...<br><br>Because of that curse, my end is<br>nigh...<br><br>Though your valiant efforts to <br>break the curse were successful, <br>I was doomed before you started...<br><br>Yes, I will pass away soon...<br>But do not grieve for me...<br><br>I have been able to tell you of <br>these important matters...<br><br>This is Hyrule's final hope...
|-
|102A||The future depends upon thee,<br>[Link]...<br>Thou art courageous...<br><br>Navi the fairy...<br>Help [Link] to carry out <br>my will...<br><br>I entreat ye... Navi...<br>Good...bye...

|104F||An evil wind is blowing from the <br>direction of the Forest Temple.<br><br>Saria left, saying,<br>"I have to do something<br>about it!"[goto 1050]
|-
|1050||The Forest Temple is located <br>in the Sacred Forest Meadow in<br>the far side of the Lost Woods.
|-
|1051||Saria went to the temple and <br>hasn't come back...
|-
|1052||Hi, mister! You can't use a<br>Deku Shield! It's only for<br>kids!
|-
|1053||Where's Saria? <br>Do you know Saria, mister?<br>That's weird...[goto 1054]
|-
|1054||Where has Mido gone during such<br>an emergency?
|-
|1055||I see. You didn't have any <br>problems entering the forest, <br>mister...<br><br>Did the meanies out there bother<br>you much? Before the Great Deku <br>Tree died, you wouldn't see things<br>like that around here....[goto 1056]
|-
|1056||Since it's dangerous outside, I <br>always stay inside my house. <br>But I'm bored to death in here!
|-
|1057||You can buy arrows at a shop <br>only if you have a bow. Have you <br>got one, mister?
|-
|1058||Have you been travelling around<br>much, mister?<br>Have you ever met a boy named <br>[Link]?<br><br>Mido said that the Great Deku <br>Tree withered because that boy<br>did something wrong to it...<br><br>Only Saria defended <br>[Link]--until she left.[goto 1059]

|1059||Maybe we misunderstood....
|-

|-
|105D||It would be awesome to be big <br>like you, mister! I really want to<br>be big like you!<br><br>I want to be big and strong and <br>beat up the Deku Scrubs, but...[goto 105E]
|-
|105E||We Kokiri won't ever get bigger <br>for the rest of our lives...<br>What a bummer!
|-

|-
|1060||What are you? Though you wear <br>Kokirish clothing, you can't<br>fool me![goto 1061]
|-
|1061||I promised Saria I would never<br>let anybody go through here.
|-
|1062||Hi there! I'm the Deku Tree <br>sprout!<br><br>Because you and Saria broke the<br>curse on the Forest Temple, I <br>can grow and flourish!<br><br>Thanks a lot!
|-
|1063||Hey, have you seen your old<br>friends? None of them recognized<br>you with your grown-up body, did<br>they?<br><br>That's because the Kokiri never<br>grow up! Even after seven years,<br>they're still kids!
|-
|1064||You must be wondering why only<br>you have grown up!<br><br>Well, as you might have already <br>guessed, you are not a Kokiri!<br>You are actually a Hylian!<br><br>I am happy to finally reveal this<br>secret to you!
|-
|1065||Some time ago, before the King of<br>Hyrule unified this country, there<br>was a fierce war in our world.One day, to escape from the fires<br>of the war, a Hylian mother and <br>her baby boy entered this <br>forbidden forest.The mother was gravely injured...<br>Her only choice was to entrust<br>the child to the Deku Tree, the <br>guardian spirit of the forest.The Deku Tree could sense that<br>this was a child of destiny, whose<br>fate would affect the entire world,<br>so he took him into the forest.After the mother passed away, <br>the baby was raised as a Kokiri.<br>And now, finally, the day of <br>destiny has come!
|-
|1066||You are a Hylian, and were<br>always bound to leave this forest.<br><br>And now...<br>You have learned your own <br>destiny...<br>So you know what you must do...<br><br>That's right...<br>You must save the land of <br>Hyrule!<br><br>Now, [Link], break the <br>curses on all of the Temples,<br>and return peace to Hyrule!!
|-
|1067||That melody?!<br><br>Saria plays that song all the <br>time!<br>You...Do you know Saria?<br><br>That song...<br><br>Saria taught that song only <br>to her friends...[goto 106F]
|-
|1068||When I see you... <br>I don't know why, but I remember...<br>him...
|-
|1069||I have you now!<br>In this gap between dreams and <br>reality, soon all that will remain<br>of you will be your dead body!
|-
|106A||Thank you...<br>Because of you, I could awaken as<br>a Sage...<br><br>I am Saria.<br>The Sage of the Forest Temple...
|-
|106B||Saria will always be...<br>your friend...
|-
|106C||The flow of time is always cruel...<br>Its speed seems different for<br>each person, but no one can <br>change it...<br><br>A thing that doesn't change with<br>time is a memory of younger days...<br><br>In order to come back here again,<br>play the Minuet of Forest.
|-
|106D||[Link]...<br>I'll see you again...
|-
|106E||Saria hasn't come back yet...<br>But I know she'll return someday...
|-
|106F||OK...<br>I trust you.[goto 1068]
|-
|1070||Oh...I see...<br><br>Saria won't ever come back...<br><br>But...I...I made a promise to <br>Saria...<br><br>If [Link] came back, I <br>would be sure to tell him that <br>Saria had been waiting for him...<br><br>Because Saria...really...<br>liked...[goto 1071]

|1073||I still think you really look like<br>somebody I've seen before, mister.
|-
|1074||You're such a big, strong guy!<br>I really want to be like you <br>someday even though I'll always be<br>small.
|-
|1075||[Link]... I wonder if he <br>will come back...
|-
|1076||I feel like I've known you for a<br>long time, mister!
|-
|1077||Now that the Deku Tree's sprout<br>is growing in the Great Deku <br>Tree's meadow, the forest has<br>returned to normal!
|-
|1078||We'll all work together to protect<br>the forest!
|-
|1079||Somehow, a fair wind has begun<br>to blow recently.
|-
|107A||Since a fair wind started to <br>blow, I'm sure [Link] <br>will come back!
|-
|107B||I wonder if Saria will come back...
|-
|107C||I'm sure [Link] will <br>return someday!
|-
|107D||Great Deku Tree...<br>I'm back!
|-
|107E||This evil man ceaselessly uses<br>his vile, sorcerous powers in his<br>search for the Sacred Realm that<br>is connected to Hyrule...<br><br>For it is in that Sacred Realm <br>that one will find the divine<br>relic, the Triforce, which contains <br>the essence of the gods...
|-
|107F||Before time began, before spirits<br>and life existed...
|-
|1080||Three golden goddesses descended<br>upon the chaos that was Hyrule...
|-
|1081||Din, the goddess of power...
|-
|1082||Nayru, the goddess of wisdom...
|-
|1083||Farore, the goddess of courage...
|-
|1084||Din...
|-
|1085||With her strong flaming arms, she<br>cultivated the land and created<br>the red earth.
|-
|1086||Nayru...
|-
|1087||Poured her wisdom onto the earth<br>and gave the spirit of law to<br>the world.
|-
|1088||Farore...
|-
|1089||With her rich soul, produced all<br>life forms who would uphold<br>the law.
|-
|108A||The three great goddesses,<br>their labors completed,<br>departed for the heavens.
|-
|108B||And golden sacred triangles<br>remained at the point where the<br>goddesses left the world.
|-
|108C||Since then, the sacred triangles<br>have become the basis of our<br>world's providence.
|-
|108D||And, the resting place of the<br>triangles has become the<br>Sacred Realm.
|-
|108E||Hey kid, you did quite well...<br>It looks like you may be gaining<br>some slight skill...But you have defeated only my<br>phantom...<br>When you fight the real me, it <br>won't be so easy!What a worthless creation that <br>ghost was! I will banish it to<br>the gap between dimensions!!
|-
|108F||I always believed that you would <br>come. Because I know you...<br><br>No...You don't have to explain<br>it to me...<br><br>Because it is destiny that you <br>and I can't live in the same world.
|-
|1090||I will stay here as the Forest<br>Sage and help you...<br><br>Now, please take this <br>Medallion...
|-
|1091||Thou hast verily demonstrated <br>thy courage...<br><br>I knew that thou wouldst be able<br>to carry out my wishes...

|1092||Now, I have yet more to tell ye,<br>wouldst thou listen...<br>Yes<br>No
|-
|1093||[Link]...<br>Go now to Hyrule Castle...<br><br>There, thou will surely meet<br>the Princess of Destiny...<br><br>Take this stone with you.<br>The stone that man wanted so<br>much, that he cast the curse on<br>me...

Find our young<br>friend and guide him to me...<br><br>I do not have much time left.<br><br>Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the<br>forest, nay, the world, depends<br>upon thee!

|-
|3008||I am one of the Gorons,<br>the stone-eating people who live<br>on Death Mountain.<br><br>Look at that huge boulder over<br>there!<br><br>It blocks the entrance to the<br>Dodongo's Cavern, which was once<br>a very important place for us<br>Gorons...<br><br>But one day, many Dodongos<br>suddenly appeared inside the <br>cavern. It became a very <br>dangerous place!<br><br>On top of that, a Gerudo in black<br>armor used his magic to seal the<br>entrance with that boulder![goto 302A]
|-
|3009||I wish I could roll down the <br>mountain like a rock, with a<br>Bomb Flower and...<br><br>BOOOOOOM!<br><br>If I could do that with a Bomb <br>Flower, I could become a real man.

|300A||I'm standing here to shade the<br>Bomb Flowers from the sun.<br><br>Do you have a question for me?<br><br>Ask about Bomb Flowers<br>Ask about Dodongo's Cavern
|-
|300B||Those plants growing over there <br>are Bomb Flowers. They are<br>"mining plants" that grow only on<br>this mountain.<br><br>The flower's fruit is the raw <br>material for bombs.<br><br>But a non-Goron amateur should <br>never pick the Bomb Flowers' <br>fruit!<br><br>They usually grow only in dark <br>places, so Bomb Flowers that grow<br>in a place like this are extremely<br>rare.

|300C||Those plants growing over there <br>are Bomb Flowers. They are<br>"mining plants" that grow only on<br>this mountain.<br><br>They usually grow only in dark <br>places, like caves, so Bomb <br>Flowers that grow in a place like<br>this are extremely rare.<br><br>If you have the Goron's Bracelet,<br>even a little kid like you could<br>easily pick it with [A].

|300D||Did you see the cavern on your <br>way here? That is the Dodongo's <br>Cavern.<br><br>Because the light inside is very <br>dim, the Bomb Flowers, a plant <br>unique to this mountain, grow like<br>crazy in there!

|300E||Oh?<br><br>We don't get many visitors way<br>up here. Where are you from?<br><br>The forest?<br><br>What's a "forest"?<br><br>Eh?<br><br>It's where a lot of "trees" and <br>"plants" grow?<br><br>Now I'm even more confused! <br>Nothing grows around here besides<br>the Bomb Flowers...<br><br>We don't have "seeds" or "nuts"<br>around here either.<br><br>Even Deku Sticks are very scarce<br>around here![goto 3022]

|300F||I sealed the entrance because I<br>don't have much merchandise to<br>sell. But you're quite a persistent<br>customer, aren't you.
|-
|3010||I'm sorry...<br>That Bomb is just for display. <br>I'm sold out of real ones.

|3011||Why did you stop me?<br>Don't stop me here!<br><br>You can't stop my wild rolling!<br><br>This wild rolling is the only way<br>to relieve my stress!<br><br>Now stand in awe of my wild, wild<br>rolling!!

|-
|3014||Oh...I'm so hungry...<br><br>Everyone feels faint from hunger<br>because of the food shortage in <br>this town. We are in danger of <br>extinction!<br><br>It's all because we can't enter<br>our quarry, the Dodongo's Cavern.<br><br>We Gorons live on a diet of <br>rocks...<br><br>And the most delicious and <br>nutritious rocks around are found <br>in the Dodongo's Cavern! But that <br>seems like ancient history now...<br><br>We've become such gourmets that <br>we can't stand to eat rocks from<br>anywhere else![goto 3015]

|3015||Sigh... I want to eat the top<br>sirloin rocks from the Dodongo's <br>Cavern!

|3016||Hey!<br><br>It's dangerous for a little kid like<br>you to come out here. You might <br>fall down!<br><br>If I'm not mistaken, you came out<br>here to eat the red stone!<br>Well, too bad! It's not here!<br><br>What? That's not why you're<br>here?<br><br>You're looking for a "Spiritual<br>Stone?" You must mean that <br>delicious-looking red stone<br>that was once displayed here!<br><br>I was so hungry that I thought<br>it would be OK to just give it one<br>tiny little lick...so I snuck out<br>here. But, it was already gone!<br><br>I think Big Brother took it away.<br><br>He always says that everyone<br>is after that red stone![goto 3017]

|3017||Big Brother has shut himself up in<br>his room saying,<br>"I will wait in here for the <br>Royal Family's messenger!"

|3018||I'm so hungry that I can't think<br>about anything but food!<br><br>Ask Big Brother about complicated<br>things.<br><br>If he's in a bad mood, he'll <br>probably get mad at you...it<br>can be pretty scary.

|301A||What the heck! Who are you?!<br><br>When I heard the song of the<br>Royal Family, I expected their <br>messenger had arrived, but...<br>you're just a little kid!<br><br>Has Darunia, the big boss of<br>the Gorons, really lost so much<br>status to be treated like this<br>by his Sworn Brother, the King?<br><br>Now, I'm REALLY angry!<br>Get out of my face, now!<br><br>Are you asking why I'm in such a<br>bad mood right now?<br><br>Ancient creatures have <br>infested the Dodongo's Cavern!<br><br>We've had a poor harvest of our<br>special crop, Bomb Flowers!<br><br>Starvation and hunger because<br>of the rock shortage!<br><br>But...[goto 301B]

|-
|301C||Heeey!! What a nice tune!<br><br>Just like that, my depression is<br>all gone! Something just came <br>over me! I suddenly wanted to<br>dance like crazy!<br><br>I am Darunia!<br><br>I'm the big boss of the Gorons!<br>Was there something you wanted <br>to ask me about?<br><br>What?<br><br>You want the Spiritual Stone of<br>Fire, too?<br><br>The Spiritual Stone of Fire, also<br>known as the Goron's Ruby, is our<br>race's hidden treasure....<br><br>But hold on--I'm not going to give<br>it to you that easily.<br>If you want it so badly...<br><br>Why don't you go destroy the <br>monsters inside of the Dodongo's <br>Cavern and prove you're a real man?<br><br>That way, everybody will be <br>happy again! If you do it, I <br>will give you anything you want,<br>even the Spiritual Stone!<br><br>I have something for you. I'm not<br>really giving you this in<br>return for anything, but take it<br>anyway.<br><br>If you wear this, even a little <br>fella like you can pick a Bomb <br>Flower using [A].

|301D||Destroy the monsters in the<br>Dodongo's Cavern and become a <br>real man! Then, we can talk about<br>the Spiritual Stone!
|-
|301E||Hey, Brother, play that tune<br>again sometime soon!
|-
|301F||No matter how many times I hear <br>that song, it doesn't get old!
|-
|3020||Well, that's not quite what I <br>was looking for...<br><br>I wanted to hear...a tune...<br>something...um...from outside <br>the mountains...something...<br>green...natural...<br><br>That's the kind of music I want <br>to hear...
|-
|3021||Oh, now we can enter the cavern.<br>You're so smart!
|-
|3022||I know a trick to conserve sticks!<br>If you light a stick on fire, it will <br>burn to ashes. Press [A] to put it<br>away before it completely burns!<br><br>By the way, I hid a stick<br>somewhere...<br>Hehehee...
|-
|3023||It's me, Darunia!<br>Well done!<br><br>Thanks to you, we can once again<br>eat the delicious rocks from the<br>Dodongo's Cavern until our <br>stomachs burst!

|-
|3070||Here's a secret for saving me!<br><br>A wall that you can destroy with<br>the Goron's "special crop" will<br>sound different than a regular<br>wall if you hit it with your sword.

|-
|4003||What are you doing? You've come <br>a long way to get up here...You should look at the Map <br>Subscreen sometimes.<br><br>[Link], this is a beautiful<br>lake full of pure, clear water.<br><br>At the lake bottom there is<br>a Water Temple used to worship <br>the water spirits. The Zoras are<br>guardians of the temple. Hoo hoo.<br><br>The Zoras come from Zora's<br>Domain in northeast Hyrule. An<br>aquatic race, they are longtime<br>allies of Hyrule's Royal Family.<br><br>I heard that only the Royal Family<br>of Hyrule can enter Zora's Domain...<br>Hoo hoo!<br><br>I'm on my way back to the castle.<br>If you want to come with me, hold<br>on to my talons!

|-
|4006||Who are you?<br><br>We are the Zoras, the proud<br>aquatic people!<br><br>So...you say you have some <br>connection with Hyrule's Royal<br>Family... <br>Well, what do you want from us?
|-
|4007||We are good at diving!<br>How about you?<br><br>If you want to be a master diver,<br>try the diving game at the top <br>of the waterfall!<br>Have you tried it already?
|-
|4008||Zora's Fountain is the <br>source of the river.<br>Lord Jabu-Jabu lives in the <br>fountain.[goto 4009]
|-
|4009||Lord Jabu-Jabu is the patron deity<br>of the Zoras. Princess Ruto is in <br>charge of preparing his meals, <br>morning and night.
|-
|400A||We Zoras all serve the great <br>King Zora.
|-
|400B||The great King Zora should be in<br>the Royal Chamber.
|-
|400C||Have you seen Lord Jabu-Jabu?<br><br>Yes<br>No
|-
|400D||According to the "Legend of Zora,"<br>the act of offering a fish to Lord <br>Jabu-Jabu will make you happy.
|-
|400E||Oh, that's not good.<br><br>Everybody who comes around here <br>should see Lord Jabu-Jabu at <br>least once!<br><br>Zora's Fountain is just beyond <br>King Zora's throne. That is where<br>Lord Jabu-Jabu swims. But...<br><br>unless you have King Zora's<br>permission, you can't go to <br>Zora's Fountain.

|400F||We haven't found Princess Ruto<br>even though some of us have <br>searched as far as Lake Hylia....

|-
|4011||All of the water in Hyrule flows<br>from Zora's Fountain.<br><br>That water flows through Zora's<br>River, which eventually reaches<br>Lake Hylia to the south.

|4013||Princess Ruto has gone to the <br>temple of Lake Hylia and has not<br>come back... I'm so worried...again!

|4014||Ooh...<br>This is... well... hmmm...<br>Hmmm... Eye drops...<br><br>You might say we have them,<br>you might say we don't...<br>We do have the ingredients.<br><br>If you take the ingredients to the<br>doctor at the lake laboratory, he<br>can make the drops for you.<br><br>But you need to deliver them<br>fresh...[goto 4015]

|4019||Oh, wow!<br><br>I haven't seen an Eyeball Frog <br>like this since Zora's Domain froze<br>over!

|606C||Hey, I heard you saved my men.<br>When they returned, we built this<br>bridge.<br><br>Look at this! <br>Isn't it a fine bridge?<br><br>They may be wimpy carpenters, <br>but once they all got together,<br>they got the job done.

|-
|7011||If you want potions, you'd better <br>bring an empty bottle. Understand,<br>young man?
|-
|7012||I'm sorry, but this is just a model. <br>Because of the crisis in Goron <br>City, we haven't received any <br>shipments lately and we're out.
|-
|7013||If you plan on scaling Death<br>Mountain, buy a Hylian Shield.<br>You can defend yourself against<br>falling rocks with that shield.<br><br>But it might be a little bit <br>big for a kid....

|-
|7015||They say we Hylians have big ears<br>in order to hear the voices of the <br>gods...but I've never heard them!

|-
|7033||Please keep this a secret from<br>everyone...<br>OK<br>No
|-
|7034||C'mon...don't be a blabber-mouth!
|-
|7035||The legend goes like this...
|-
|7036||The three goddesses hid the<br>Triforce containing the power of<br>the gods somewhere in Hyrule.The power<br>to grant the wish of the one who<br>holds the Triforce in his hands.If someone with a righteous heart<br>makes a wish, it will lead Hyrule<br>to a golden age of prosperity....If someone with an evil mind has<br>his wish granted, the world will<br>be consumed by evil...That is what<br>has been told....So, the ancient Sages built<br>the Temple of Time to protect the<br>Triforce from evil ones.
|-
|7037||That's right... The Temple of Time<br>is the entrance through which you<br>can enter the Sacred Realm from<br>our world.<br><br>But the entrance is sealed with<br>a stone wall called the <br>Door of Time.<br><br>And, in order to open the door,<br>it is said that you need to collect<br>three Spiritual Stones.<br><br>And another thing you need...is<br>the treasure that the Royal Family<br>keeps along with this legend...

|7038||Oh, I'm sorry. <br>I'm not very good at storytelling...

|7039||What happened? Did he see you?<br><br>Don't worry.<br><br>He doesn't have any idea what<br>we're planning...yet!

|703C||My attendant will guide you out of<br>the castle. Don't be afraid to talk<br>to her.

|703D||The Spiritual Stone...<br>You finally found it!<br><br>It is said that the races that hold<br>the Spiritual Stones open their<br>minds only to one who knows the<br>melody of the Royal Family.<br><br>But you already know that, don't<br>you?

|703E||Hey, have you heard that<br>Princess Zelda sees prophetic <br>visions in her dreams?
|-
|703F||Huh? What? Shoo, kid! Shoo!

|7040||There are three hollows and <br>an inscription here....<br><br>Ye who owns 3 Spiritual Stones <br>Stand with the Ocarina of Time<br>And play the Song of Time<br><br>That is how the inscription reads.

|7052||Right, it looks like you are <br>confused... Let me tell you <br>again, from the beginning.[goto 7051]
|-
|7053||But, remember...<br><br>Though you opened the Door of <br>Time in the name of peace...<br><br>Ganondorf, the Gerudo King of<br>Thieves, used it to enter this <br>forbidden Sacred Realm!<br><br>He obtained the Triforce from<br>the Temple of Light, and with its <br>power, he became the King of Evil...<br><br>His evil power radiated from the<br>temples of Hyrule, and in seven<br>short years, it transformed Hyrule<br>into a world of monsters.<br><br>My power now has only little <br>influence, even in this Sacred<br>Realm...<br><br>Namely, this Chamber of Sages.<br><br>But there is still hope...<br><br>The power of the Sages remains.<br><br>When the power of all the Sages<br>is awakened...<br><br>The Sages' Seals will contain<br>all the evil power in the void of <br>the Realm...<br><br>I, Rauru, am one of the Sages...<br>And...<br><br>Your power to fight together with<br>the Sages makes you the <br>Hero of Time!<br><br>The Hero of Time, chosen by the<br>Master Sword!<br><br>Keep my spirit with you...<br>And, find the power of the other<br>Sages and add their might to your<br>own!

|-
|705C||If you would seek the sacred<br>triangle, listen well...The resting place of the sacred<br>triangle, the Sacred Realm, is a<br>mirror that reflects what is<br>in the heart...the heart of one who enters it...<br>If an evil heart, the Realm will<br>become full of evil; if pure,<br>the Realm will become a paradise.The Triforce...the sacred triangle...<br>it is a balance that weighs the<br>three forces:<br>Power, Wisdom and Courage.If the heart of the one who holds<br>the sacred triangle has all three<br>forces in balance, that one will<br>gain the True Force to govern all.But, if that one's heart is not in<br>balance, the Triforce will separate<br>into three parts:<br>Power, Wisdom and Courage.Only one part will remain for the<br>one who touched the Triforce...the<br>part representing the force that<br>one most believes in.If that one seeks the True Force,<br>that one must acquire the two<br>lost parts.Those two parts will be held<br>within others chosen by destiny,<br>who will bear the Triforce mark<br>on the backs of their hands.

|705D||Seven years ago, Ganondorf, the <br>King of Thieves, used the door <br>you opened in the Temple of Time<br>and entered the Sacred Realm.<br><br>But when he laid his hands on the<br>Triforce, the legend came true.

|-
|706E||Oh sealed door opened by the <br>Sages... Close forever with <br>the Evil Incarnation of Darkness<br>within!!
|-
|706F||Thank you, [Link]...<br><br>Thanks to you, Ganondorf has<br>been sealed inside the Evil Realm!<br><br>Thus, peace will once again<br>reign in this world...for a time.
|-
|7070||Thank you...<br>[Link]...Good-bye....
|-
|7071||Do you really want to go through<br>this gate that much? Let me think<br>about it... OK, but in return...[goto 7072]
|-
|7072||Give me 10 Rupees...<br><br>Yes<br>No
|-
|7073||Please believe me....<br>My prophecies have never been<br>wrong!
|-
|7074||You destroyed the wicked<br>creatures that haunted the temple<br>and awakened the Sage...<br><br>But there are still other Sages<br>who need your help.<br><br>In order to awaken all the other<br>Sages, you must become even<br>more powerful.<br><br>You must travel over<br>mountains...<br><br>under water...<br><br>and even through time...
|-
|7075||As long as you hold the Ocarina<br>of Time and the Master Sword,<br><br>you hold time itself in your<br>hands...<br><br>[Link], we shall meet <br>again!
|-
|7076||This is a new type of bomb!<br>It's available only in limited<br>quantities, and when I'm sold <br>out, that's it!
|-
|7077||I am Sheik.<br>Survivor of the Sheikahs...
|-
|7078||As I see you standing there<br>holding the mythical Master <br>Sword, you really do look like the <br>legendary Hero of Time...
|-
|7079||If you believe the legend, you<br>have no choice. You must look for<br>the five temples and awaken the<br>five Sages....
|-
|707A||One Sage is waiting for the time<br>of awakening in the Forest Temple.<br>The Sage is a girl I am sure you<br>know...<br><br>Because of the evil power in the<br>temple, she cannot hear the<br>awakening call from the Sacred<br>Realm...<br><br>Unfortunately, equipped as you <br>currently are, you cannot even<br>enter the temple...<br><br>But, if you believe what I'm saying,<br>you should head to Kakariko <br>Village...<br><br>Do you understand, <br>[Link]?
|-
|707B||I thought I should entrust the<br>Ocarina to you... I thought that <br>would be our best chance...
|-
|707C||Before that...I have things I want <br>to tell only to you. Please listen.<br><br>Another unknown legend of the <br>Triforce passed down by the <br>shadow folk, the Sheikahs....
|-
|707D||The Triforce separated into three <br>parts. Only the Triforce of Power<br>remained in Ganondorf's hand.
|-
|707E||The strength of the Triforce of<br>Power enabled him to become a<br>mighty, evil king, but his dark<br>ambitions were not satisfied.
|-
|707F||To gain complete mastery of the <br>world, Ganondorf started looking<br>for those chosen by destiny to <br>hold the two other Triforce parts.
|-
|7080||On that day, seven years ago,<br>Ganondorf attacked Hyrule Castle.
|-
|7081||After you opened the door of <br>time, the Master Sword sealed you<br>away in the Sacred Realm...
|-
|7082||Your spirit remained in the Sacred<br>Realm...and then the Triforce fell <br>into Ganondorf's hands. He went<br>on to invade the Sacred Realm...<br><br>Ganondorf had become the Evil<br>King, and the Sacred Realm<br>became a world of evil. All of<br>this is an unfortunate coincidence.<br><br>I passed myself off as a Sheikah<br>and hoped that you would return.<br>I waited for seven years...
|-
|7083||And...now you are back. The <br>dark age ruled by Ganondorf the<br>Evil King will end!
|-
|7084||The six Sages will open the sealed<br>door and lure Ganondorf back into<br>the Sacred Realm.<br><br>I will then seal the door to the <br>Sacred Realm from this world.<br><br>Thus, Ganondorf the Evil King will<br>vanish from Hyrule.<br><br>[Link]...<br>In order to do this, I need your <br>courage again. Please protect me<br>while I do my part.<br><br>And here is a weapon that can <br>penetrate the Evil King's defenses...<br>The power given to the chosen <br>ones...<br><br>The sacred Arrow of Light!!!
|-
|7085||But you let your guard down...<br>I knew you would appear if I let<br>this kid wander around!
|-
|7086||My only mistake was to slightly<br>underestimate the power of this<br>kid...
|-
|7087||No...<br>It was not the kid's power I<br>misjudged, it was the power of<br>the Triforce of Courage!<br><br>But, with the Triforce of Wisdom<br>that Zelda has...<br>When I obtain these two Triforces...<br><br>Then, I will become the true<br>ruler of the world!!
|-
|7088||The Ocarina of Time opened the<br>door. The Hero of Time, with the<br>Master Sword, descended here.
|-
|7089||It seems strange that packs of<br>dogs roam our streets at night...<br>Doesn't that seem weird to you?
|-
|708A||Hey, sonny, I'll tell you something<br>helpful...<br><br>I heard there is a mysterious <br>fountain somewhere near the <br>castle...
|-
|708B||If you want to return to your<br>original time, return the Master <br>Sword to the Pedestal of Time.<br><br>By doing this, you will travel back<br>in time seven years....
|-
|708C||The time will come when you will<br>have to return here quickly...<br>I will teach this to you for when <br>that time comes...<br><br>The song to return you to the <br>Temple of Time...<br>The Prelude of Light...
|-
|708D||I am Impa of the Sheikahs.<br>I am responsible for protecting<br>Princess Zelda. Everything is <br>exactly as the Princess foretold.
|-
|708E||If the castle soldiers find you,<br>there will be trouble. Let me <br>lead you out of the castle.
|-
|708F||Hey you! Don't cause any trouble!
|-
|7090||You are a courageous boy...<br>You are heading out on a big, new <br>adventure, aren't you?<br><br>My role in the Princess's dream<br>was to teach a melody to the one<br>from the forest.<br><br>This is an ancient melody passed <br>down by the Royal Family.<br><br>I have played this song for <br>Princess Zelda as a lullaby ever<br>since she was a baby...<br><br>There is mysterious power in <br>these notes.<br><br>Now listen carefully...
|-
|7091||All the tragedy that has befallen<br>Hyrule was my doing...<br><br>I was so young...I could not<br>comprehend the consequences of <br>trying to control the Sacred Realm.<br><br>I dragged you into it, too.<br>Now it is time for me to make up <br>for my mistakes...<br><br>You must lay the Master Sword to <br>rest and close the Door of Time...
|-
|7092||However, by doing this, the road<br>between times will be closed...
|-
|7093||[Link],<br>give the Ocarina to me...<br><br>As a Sage, I can return you<br>to your original time with it.
|-
|7094||When peace returns to Hyrule...<br><br>It will be time for us to say <br>good-bye...
|-
|7095||Now, go home, [Link].<br>Regain your lost time!<br><br>Home... <br>where you are supposed to be...<br>the way you are supposed to be...
|-
|7096||Tsk Tsk.
|-
|7097||Well, maybe that's too much<br>for a kid to pay.
|-
|7098||OK, I'll let you pass,<br>quickly!
|-
|7099||KEEP IT A SECRET <br>FROM EVERYONE.
|-
|709A||Man, I am SO tired!<br><br>The night watch is so boring!<br>I wish some ghosts would come <br>out or something...<br><br>Hey, I'm really interested in <br>ghosts!<br><br>Studying them is a hobby of mine,<br>but you never know...the time<br>might come when that kind of<br>knowledge might be useful!
|-
|709B||My precious little puppy's fur coat<br>is very special compared to the <br>other mutts around here!
|-
|709C||My precious puppy can run faster<br>than any of the other mutts<br>around here!
|-
|709D||I can't find my puppy anywhere!<br>I need you to look for it! Please!
|-
|709E||Arrrgh!<br>That is not my dog! <br>How could you mix up my puppy<br>with a mutt like that?!
|-
|709F||Richard!<br><br>This is my little Richard!<br>Thank you! Thank you!<br>I'll give this to you as a<br>reward!
|-
|70A0||At night it's dangerous to go out<br>with all the wild dogs around...<br>No, I wasn't warning you! <br>I'm worried about my puppy!

They hate the world!<br><br>Young man, if you catch a Poe, I<br>will pay a lot of money for it...<br>Heh heh hee!

|-
|70F8||Wait a minute! WOW!<br><br>You have earned 1,000 points!<br><br>Young man, you are a genuine<br>Ghost Hunter!<br><br>Is that what you expected me to<br>say? Heh heh heh!<br><br>Because of you, I have extra<br>inventory of Big Poes, so this will<br>be the last time I can buy a <br>ghost.<br><br>You're thinking about what I <br>promised would happen when you<br>earned 1,000 points. Heh heh.<br><br>Don't worry, I didn't forget.<br>Just take this.
|-
|70F9||Oh? What's that?<br><br>Is that...
|-
|70FA||a fairy?!<br><br>Then, are you...<br>Are you from the forest?
|-
|70FB||Then...then...you wouldn't happen to<br>have...the Spiritual Stone of the <br>Forest, would you?! That green <br>and shining stone...
|-
|70FC||I had a dream...In the dream,<br>dark storm clouds were billowing<br>over the land of Hyrule...<br><br>But suddenly, a ray of light shot<br>out of the forest, parted the<br>clouds and lit up the ground...<br><br>The light turned into a figure<br>holding a green and shining stone,<br>followed by a fairy...
|-
|70FD||I know this is a prophecy that<br>someone would come from the<br>forest...<br><br>Yes, I thought you might<br>be the one...
|-
|70FE||Oh, I'm sorry!<br><br>I got carried away with my story <br>and didn't even properly introduce <br>myself!
|-
|70FF||I am Zelda, Princess of Hyrule.
|-
|7100||What? Have we met before?
|-
|7101||Awww... That's so cute!<br>Could you tell me where you<br>found it?
|-
|7102||Yeeeah!<br>Help me!
|-
|7103||Uh...yeah? So what?
|-
|7104||I hate foxes!
|-
|7105||How irritating!
|-
|7106||Hey, you look good!
|-
|7107||YEEEAH! What's your problem?!
|-
|7108||Oooh...is that a Zora?<br>Those cool eyes are really<br>fascinating...
|-
|7109||Oh no! You're scary!<br>Don't come any closer!
|-
|710A||Wow...how nostalgic! That<br>reminds me of when I was a<br>little kid.
|-
|710B||That's kind of funny...it<br>makes me laugh!<br>Hee hee!
|-
|710C||Uh-oh! I'm sorry, mom!<br>Oh...hey, it's you!<br>Don't scare me like<br>that!
|-
|710D||What a big head you have!
|-
|710E||Oh, don't do that!<br>I'm shy...
|-
|710F||Is there a mask competition<br>going on? <br>I'm going to vote for you!
|-
|7110||Oh! A rabbit!<br>Speaking of rabbits, I saw a <br>strange man chasing rabbits <br>around...
|-
|7111||Oooh, what a pretty lady!<br>But you're kind of short,<br>aren't you?
|-
|7112||Well...I can't think of anything<br>funny to say...sorry, kid!
|-
|7113||A mask... When I was a little <br>kid, I also wore masks around...<br>What? You say you can't imagine<br>me doing that?
|-
|7114||Ohhhh...I see...<br>It's an illusion...
|-
|7115||Hey, kid, don't grow up to be<br>like me...
|-
|7116||AAAAAAAAAAAH!<br>A GERUDO!!!!<br><br>Wha-? A mask?<br>Why do you have a mask <br>like that?!
|-
|7117||Sorry, I'm busy right now.
|-
|7118||Oh wow! It's Keaton!<br>Hi, Keaton!
|-
|7119||How spooky!<br>There's a boy in Kakariko<br>Village who was looking for a<br>mask like that!
|-
|711A||Hmm...well...don't you have any<br>other masks?
|-
|711B||What a strange mask!<br>Hee hah haa!
|-
|711C||Hey kid! Can't you see we're<br>busy?! Leave us alone!
|-
|711D||I'm sorry. I don't even want to<br>look at any other woman!
|-
|711E||Hee hee.<br>Don't pay any attention to that<br>kid, my dear... Just pretend we're<br>in our own, private little world...
|-
|711F||Oh, please!<br>Go bother someone <br>else!
|-
|7120||There's a rumor going around that<br>there is a Potion Shop that can<br>make the ultimate medicine!
|-
|7121||I heard a rumor that there is a <br>monster that eats Hylian Shields<br>somewhere out there in the world.<br>Have you ever seen it?
|-
|7122||I came here to sell bombs...<br>Please buy some!
|-
|7123||I...I am afraid...<br>I have a feeling that man is going<br>to destroy Hyrule.<br><br>He has such terrifying power!<br><br>But it's fortunate that you have <br>come...
|-
|7124||What? If you want something,<br>just make it clear!
|-
|7125||I'm busy! Get out of my way,<br>you bum!
|-
|7126||Hey, you have some good,<br>quality wood there, kid!
|-
|7127||Hrrrrm!<br>Get out of my face!<br>You good for nothin'...
|-
|7128||EEEEEEAAAAH!<br>Whoops, I shouldn't scream like<br>that or the boss will yell at me!
|-
|7129||Oh, sorry boss! <br>I didn't mean to slack off!<br>I'll get busy!<br><br>Oh, that's not you, boss?
|-
|712A||Gerudos are beautiful and brave...<br>They are just so fascinating!
|-
|712B||Someday, when I have more skill,<br>I'll carve a mask like that one!
|-
|712C||Oh, that's the mask<br>everyone is talking about!<br>Looks kind of strange...
|-
|712D||Wa-ha-hah!<br>How's business,<br>Mr. Hero?<br>Hah hah hah!
|-
|712E||I'm on duty.<br>Understand?<br>ON DUTY!
|-
|712F||Hmm, well, I don't really know<br>what to say about that one...
|-
|7130||Oh wow! Cute!<br>But Cuccos are much cuter!
|-
|7131||Eh, what?<br>Are you sad?<br>Happy?<br>I really can't tell...
|-
|7132||I'm sorry, I'm not really<br>interested in that.
|-
|7133||The little kid playing in the<br>graveyard was saying something<br>about his face...
|-
|7134||I really am a good man.<br>Don't you believe me?
|-
|7135||WHAAAA--!<br>I thought you were that old hag!<br>Don't scare me like that!
|-
|7136||I remember my father talking<br>about a swordsmith...but that<br>doesn't really matter to me<br>anyway.
|-
|7137||I'm not afraid of any forest <br>monsters! Are you trying to<br>make fun of me?
|-
|7138||What is that? I can't see it<br>very well from here...
|-
|7139||Hi again! How are you today?
|-
|713A||Everything's fine today!
|-
|713B||Tired...I'm so tired...
|-
|713C||I don't care about any<br>foxes!
|-
|713D||That's irritating!<br>It bothers my eyes!
|-
|713E||That looks quite handsome!
|-
|713F||Waaaaaaah!<br>What is wrong with you?<br>Do you have a bad attitude?
|-
|7140||You idiot! <br>When you talk to someone, you<br>should make eye contact!
|-
|7141||You idiot!<br>When you talk to someone, you<br>shouldn't stare!
|-
|7142||You idiot!<br>When you talk to someone, you<br>should take off your mask!
|-
|7143||You idiot!<br>I don't know why I'm calling<br>you that, but...you are one!
|-
|7144||Where did you get that?<br>What?<br>It's a mask?
|-
|7145||Uh, leave me alone...<br>Can't you see I'm in a groove<br>right now?
|-
|7146||A mask is just like a musical <br>instrument--it reflects the<br>character of its owner. I like<br>your originality, kid!
|-
|7147||What a big head!<br>How'd you fit through that door?!
|-
|7148||I HATE foxes, sonny!
|-
|7149||Now if that isn't the most<br>irritating face I've seen in<br>all my days, I don't know what<br>is!
|-
|714A||Hey, that's a fine face<br>you got there, sonny!
|-
|714B||Have you got any complaints?<br>Speak up, then!
|-
|714C||Please quit playing around<br>and dispel our curse!
|-
|714D||If I wore something like that...<br>I'd be a real Skulltula...<br>AAAAAAAAAAH!
|-
|714E||Please understand if I don't<br>laugh... It's hard to be happy<br>in this condition... <br>Being cursed and all...
|-
|714F||[sound 6867]Hyaaaaah!<br>That's scary!<br>I know I'm scary, but...man!<br>That's really scary!
|-
|7150||Huh?! Wha--!<br><br>Oh, it's just a kid.<br>Don't scare me like that!<br>I may not look like it, but I'm a<br>very sensitive guy!
|-
|7151||Well, will you lookit the noggin on <br>this kid! It's HUGE!<br>Mine is huge too, though...
|-
|7152||Do you know what kind of<br>mask you're wearing...?<br>And you're still wearing it?
|-
|7153||I'm on duty now... <br>If you want me to dig, don't<br>bother me.
|-
|7154||What is that? It's something<br>that hops around in a field...<br>I forgot what those things are<br>called...
|-
|7155||Hey! It's a Keaton Mask!!<br>I asked my daddy to get me one,<br>too!
|-
|7156||That's not very different from<br>Mr. Damp?, is it?
|-
|7157||That doesn't look anything like<br>Mr. Damp?, huh?
|-
|7158||[sound 6863]Hey, cool mask...but a little<br>scary, don't you think?
|-
|7159||Hey! That looks familiar...<br>I think I saw something like it<br>in the Lost Woods, no?
|-
|715A||[sound 6863]That makes me feel...happy...
|-
|715B||Oh...uh...sniff...<br>That mask...<br>It makes me feel...sad...
|-
|715C||Hah! That mask won't do you any<br>good! You're just afraid of me,<br>the great Mido...aren't you?!
|-
|715D||Waaaaah! What?<br>Hey, I'm not scared of you!<br>Just don't come any closer,<br>understand?!
|-
|715E||Hey, that's a cool mask.<br>I want it!<br>JUST KIDDING! Hah!<br>I don't want that stupid mask!
|-
|715F||Wah hah ha hah!<br>That really suits you!
|-
|7160||Waaaah!<br>I-I'm gonna tell Mido about <br>this!
|-
|7161||Yeeeeah!<br>I-I'm gonna tell Mido to beat<br>you up!
|-
|7162||Whooooah!<br>Are you some kind of forest<br>ghost?
|-
|7163||That's so cool!<br>Uh...don't tell Mido I said that!
|-
|7164||What?!<br>You came back!<br>I can tell who you are, even<br>with that mask on!
|-
|7165||I wonder what Mido would say if<br>he saw that?<br>I really would like to see his<br>reaction!
|-
|7166||I see...<br>You're going to scare Mido with<br>that mask, aren't you?!
|-
|7167||Hah hah hah!<br>What a funny face!<br>I bet Saria would think it's<br>pretty funny, too!
|-
|7168||Tee hee hee!<br>A mask made of wood?<br>It looks like you're wearing<br>a shield on your face!
|-
|7169||What a weird face!<br><br>Speaking of weird faces, one of<br>the forest kids was complaining<br>about his face...
|-
|716A||What an enormous head you have!
|-
|716B||Tee hee!<br>Where did you get that?<br>Outside the forest?<br>No way! I don't believe it!
|-
|716C||Hee hee!<br>Kind of funny, but it's not<br>really my style...
|-
|716D||Right on! <br>Wearing this mask makes me feel<br>really tough and scary!<br>Hee hee!
|-
|716E||Hee hee!<br>There sure are a lot of different<br>people in the world!
|-
|716F||Hee hee!<br>I don't need a new one...<br>I like the one I have, thanks!
|-
|7170||[sound 686D]Wow, that makes your head<br>look huge!<br>Hee hee!
|-
|7171||[sound 686B]What a cute little mouse!<br>What?<br>Oh, it's not a mouse?
|-
|7172||[sound 686C]What are those floppy things<br>on your head?<br>Ears? That mask makes you look<br>like you have four ears!
|-
|7173||[sound 6869]It must be exciting to sneak<br>past the guards while wearing<br>that mask!
|-
|7174||Hi, fairy boy!<br>What?<br>You think you're in disguise?<br>But it's so obvious who you are!
|-
|7175||Wow!<br>What big eyes you have!<br>Gorons are so cute, aren't they!
|-
|7176||Oh, I know that character!<br>It's Keaton!<br>He's very hot in Hyrule Castle<br>Town right now!
|-
|7177||Oh, brother!<br>Boys will be boys!
|-
|7178||Wait...wait...<br>I know who ya are...<br>Yer... Kin-ton!<br>Ain't that right?!
|-
|7179||That's a scary one, ain't it?<br>Almost as scary as...Ingo!
|-
|717A||Hey, that reminds me of my wife...<br>On second thought, it doesn't...<br>It doesn't look like her at all!
|-
|717B||YAAAWWN...<br>I'm kinda tired right now...<br>Show it to me later...
|-
|717C||Scram, kid!<br>Can't you see I'm busy?!
|-
|717D||Humph!<br>It's fine to play like that when <br>you're a kid, but just wait until<br>you grow up! Work, work, work!
|-
|717E||YEOW!<br>Humph. It's just a mask...<br>Scram, kid! Get out of here!
|-
|717F||Heh heh heh...<br>Well, that cheered me up a little,<br>kid.<br>Thanks!
|-
|7180||Hmmm... Let's see...<br>Yes, I'm quite sure of it...<br>That was manufactured from a <br>plank from a coffin. Yes, it was!
|-
|7181||Ahhh...yes. Let's see...<br>Very fine craftsmanship.<br>But I don't think it would make<br>a good ingredient for my medicine.
|-
|7182||Very interesting! A Goron!<br>Speaking of Gorons, I wonder<br>how my old friend, Biggoron of<br>Death Mountain, is doing?
|-
|7183||Very unusual construction...<br>I don't think it's water soluble,<br>so it wouldn't make a good <br>ingredient for my medicines...
|-
|7184||Chomp chomp chomp...<br>OK, OK, a mask.<br>Do you want to buy some beans?
|-
|7185||Chomp chomp chomp...<br>Nope, I don't want to buy it.
|-
|7186||Chomp chomp chomp...<br>Nope, it's not my style.
|-
|7187||Chomp chomp chomp...<br>Well...no, I don't think I <br>want it.
|-
|7188||What do you want?
|-
|7189||You don't look like you can<br>swim very well...
|-
|718A||Red hair...tan skin...<br>I've seen people like that before...
|-
|718B||Yeah, right.<br>You look a little small for a<br>Zora...
|-
|718C||Ho ho ho!<br>You Hylians...you are such silly<br>creatures!
|-
|718D||That face...it gives me the chills...
|-
|718E||Talk about a nostalgia trip!<br>That reminds me of my childhood<br>friend, Biggoron!
|-
|718F||I don't think that's funny at all.<br>Are you mocking me?
|-
|7190||You're a funny guy!
|-
|7191||Your head--it's gigantic!
|-
|7192||Don't do that...<br>It's embarrassing me!
|-
|7193||All right! You actually decided<br>to become a Zora!<br>Are you actually ready to marry<br>me now?
|-
|7194||WHOA!<br>My heart...started to beat <br>so fast!
|-
|7195||That's an unpleasant mask...<br>Good-bye.
|-
|7196||Hrrrrm...<br>I don't know what to say.
|-
|7197||You shouldn't be so picky about<br>what you eat! Do you eat all your<br>green rocks? If you don't, you <br>won't grow up big and strong!
|-
|7198||Leave me alone!
|-
|7199||Are you trying to make me laugh?<br>Well, that's not that funny...
|-
|719A||You're making me mad!
|-
|719B||I hate Gerudos!!
|-
|719C||Quit pestering me!<br>Go away!
|-
|719D||Wah hah hah!<br>Do you think you're in disguise?<br>How funny!
|-
|719E||Out of my way!<br>Get out of here!<br>You're asking for it, aren't you?
|-
|719F||Hey, kid, you've got guts coming<br>around here wearing that!<br>Still, you can't fool us that<br>easily!
|-
|71A0||What is that?<br>What does it have to do with<br>us?
|-
|71A1||Ha ha hah!<br>You've got guts to spare, don't<br>you kid? <br>I like you!
|-
|71A2||C'mon! It's time to get serious!
|-
|71A3||That's odd...it kind of looks like<br>me...<br>No...not really.  Not at all,<br>if you look at it closely.
|-
|71A4||Hmm. No, no, no!<br>The ears aren't right at all!<br>They should be, you know, longer!
|-
|71A5||Aren't you kind of scared, <br>walking around in the middle of<br>the night looking like that?
|-
|71A6||Ha ha hah!<br>You really like those things,<br>don't you?!
|-
|71A7||I think I've seen a stone that<br>looks like that somewhere...<br>Now where was that?<br>Hmmmm....
|-
|71A8||Hurry up, [Link]!<br>Any second now, the tower is <br>going to collapse!!
|-
|71A9||Watch out for falling rubble!
|-
|71AA||[Link]!<br>Help me!
|-
|71AB||[Link]!<br>The exit is just over there!
|-
|71AC||Thank you, [Link].<br>Now, let's hurry!
|-
|71AD||Too bad!<br><br>Practice hard and come back!
|-
|71AE||Almost!!<br><br>Well...all right!<br>I'll let you try one more time for<br>free...<br>This time, you gotta do it!
|-
|71AF||Wonderful!!!<br>Bravo!!!<br>Perfect!!!<br><br>Here's a fantastic present!
|-
|71B0||Oh, no! Time's up!<br>The thing you were going to <br>deliver has spoiled!<br>Let's try again!
|-
|71B1||BOINNG! BOINNG!<br>The current time is: [World Time]!
|-
|71B2||You heard about us from the<br>guard at Death Mountain gate?<br>Well, I have to give<br>you a good deal then!
